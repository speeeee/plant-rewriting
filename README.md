# Plant rewriting
This is a very simple implementation of the language used in the first 2 chapters of _The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants_ by Prusienkiewicz and Lindenmayer.  The language so far covers up to a parametric 0L-system, although the condition of the parametric system is not defined (though defining it shouldn't be difficult).
